## [2026-04-26] — v2.6+v2.7+v2.8 Retrofit (Primary-source synthesis depth + page-output discipline)

**Trigger**: Schema retrofit pass applying CLAUDE.md v2.6 (Rules #19–#20: shareholder-letter + 10-K MD&A primary-source synthesis), v2.7 (5-year 10-K + letter baselines, quarterly-letter Pattern B substitution), and v2.8 (Rules #21–#26: synthesis over transcription, output discipline, moat consolidation, competitive-landscape integration, risk-factor materiality filter, R/R discipline). EBAY was on v2.5 and was missing the multi-year primary-source baselines.

**Sources reviewed (newly fetched / referenced)**:
- 10-K FY2025 (filed 2026-02-19) — `raw/EBAY/filings/EBAY-10K-FY2025.url`
- 10-K FY2024, FY2023, FY2022, FY2021 — SEC EDGAR HTML (URL pointer files in `raw/EBAY/filings/`)

**Letter pattern**: Pattern C (per Core Rule #19) — eBay does not publish a standalone annual or quarterly shareholder letter. Iannone's commentary lives in quarterly earnings PRs, transcripts, and DEF 14A intro letters. Pattern C gap documented in `raw/EBAY/shareholder-letters/PATTERN_C_NOTE.md`. Section 6 RMC drew from FY2021–FY2025 quarterly earnings PR commentary archive + 10-K FY2025 verbatim quotes.

### What Changed (sections refreshed)

- **Header**: Schema v2.5 → v2.8; Last Updated 2026-04-25 → 2026-04-26.
- **Summary**: Refreshed to v2.8 format — 10 emoji-tagged bullets, moat verdict line per Rule #23, R/R figure per Rule #26.
- **Business Overview**: Tightened; removed standalone "Moat Assessment" block per Rule #23 (moat detail now lives only in Section 5).
- **Pivotal Investment Question**: Re-framed around the genuinely new agentic-commerce risk vector vs. the legacy "Amazon erosion" framing.
- **Section 1**: Refreshed framing in light of agentic-commerce question.
- **Section 2**: Added `### Primary Source: 10-K Segment Detail (FY2021 → FY2025)` subsection per Rule #20 — multi-year MD&A synthesis on take-rate expansion (+200bps in 5 yrs), active-buyer base inflection (132M → 134M → 135M), Focus Categories ~30% of GMV in FY25 vs. "investing" framing in FY22.
- **Section 4**: Added explicit advertising-revenue transparency-gap callout.
- **Section 5**: Per Rule #23 + #24 — added mandatory `### Competitive Landscape` subsection with full peer table (AMZN, MELI, ETSY, Vinted, Whatnot, StockX, Poshmark, Mercari, Depop, Facebook Marketplace, Fanatics) including market share / scale and threat-vector reads. Added agentic-commerce as new vulnerability.
- **Section 6**: Added `### Recent Management Commentary — Primary Source Synthesis` subsection per Rule #19 with verbatim quotes mapped to investment relevance + 5-Year Strategic Framework Arc (FY21–FY25) traced through three coherent stages.
- **Section 8**: Per Rule #25 — applied materiality filter, dropped boilerplate (generic cyber, FX, payments regulation), elevated **agentic-commerce / LLM disintermediation** (NEW in FY25 10-K, NOT priced in) and **de minimis exemption removal** (NEW in FY25 10-K, partially priced) as headline risks. Per Rule #21 — replaced 5-Year Risk Factor Evolution table with 2–4-sentence synthesis paragraph naming the genuine multi-year worldview shift.
- **Section 9**: Added agentic-commerce + de minimis macro overlay.
- **Section 10**: Refreshed multiples; trough-vs-normalized framing rewrite.
- **Section 11**: Refreshed price/sentiment/upcoming catalysts as of 2026-04-26 (rolled date forward by 1 day; added EU de minimis July 2026 watch, DEF 14A spring proxy filing).
- **Section 12 (BAIT)**: Refreshed Analytical edge to incorporate active-buyer inflection + transparency-gap modeling edge; added agentic-commerce as new analytical wildcard.
- **Section 13**: Adjusted Bear case to $60 from $70 to incorporate agentic-commerce + de minimis downside; PW EV recalculated.
- **Section 14**: PW EV ~$115 → ~$113 (recomputed). R/R figure framed per Rule #26 — headline ~1.2 : 1 Bull-vs-Bear, secondary 2.4 : 1 Bull-vs-Base.
- **Section 15**: Updated thesis sentence to incorporate agentic-commerce framing; added new thesis-break triggers for AI-search referral decline (>15%), cross-border GMV decline (>10%), Whatnot/Fanatics breakout.

### Thesis Status

- **Overall**: 🟡 **Unchanged** (Hold / Watch). The headline price, recommendation verbs, and zone framework are preserved; primary-source enrichment sharpens the *risk* picture (agentic-commerce + de minimis are genuinely new and not yet priced in) but does not alter the central recommendation.
- **BAIT delta**: A bumped slightly on active-buyer inflection + transparency-gap edge; B/I unchanged (Weak); T unchanged (Moderate). Verdict still Low-Moderate Conviction.
- **Price target delta**: Bull $145 (unchanged) | Base $115 (unchanged) | Bear $70 → **$60** (incorporates agentic-commerce + de minimis tail). PW EV $115 → ~$113.
- **Catalyst & Sentiment delta**: No price action since prior entry (one trading day); analyst consensus and short interest unchanged. New macro watch: EU de minimis July 2026 effective date.

### Recommendation

- **For a non-holder**: 🟡 Watch / selective Initiate — wait for $80 weakness or sustained reacceleration print + early agentic-commerce read.
- **For a current holder**: 🟡 Hold — capital return + reacceleration support; trim toward $115+.

**Next review trigger**: Q1 2026 earnings, early May 2026 (first read on de minimis cross-border GMV impact + any agentic-commerce / AI shopping-agent pilot metrics).

### Thesis Status
